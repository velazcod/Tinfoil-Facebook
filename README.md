# Tinfoil for Facebook

## Description (from F-Droid)

Browse Facebook's mobile web site with a simple web browser, which protects your privacy by avoiding the ability of the page and others to track your browsing history.
It also includes other functionalities, like shortcuts to the notifications page or app settings to control whether your current location is to be provided to Facebook's website.

The COARSE_LOCATION permission is only used if you enable "Allow Check-ins" on the preferences section, which is disabled by default.
