Problems:

* It would be nice to run this as single instance, but file upload gets broken due to
  startActivityForResult getting cancelled as soon as it's called from a singleInstance
  activity.

* Better support for facebook linker (l.php) and avoid blank pages when coming back to app.

* Will add more soon.

* Fix touch delegation issues. (video playback, for example)


New features to keep in mind:

* Multiple accounts?
